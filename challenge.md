Together with the [Navitrace benchmark](https://leggedrobotics.github.io/navitrace_webpage/), we present a challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in robot navigation. Given the promise and increasing focus on VLMs in robotics, we seek to provide a benchmark to compare VLM-based approaches and to gauge progress in this field.

We invite submissions applying VLMs or Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) to our publicly hosted [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/leggedrobotics/navitrace_leaderboard). Submissions before the cutoff date (_TBC_) will be considered for the Navitrace Challenge prize, to be announced and given out at the workshop.

🏆 **Challenge Winner Award**: _TBC_
