This workshop focuses on robust open-world navigation (OWN) in the era of foundation models. While large-scale data and foundation models have enabled impressive generalization across environments, embodiments, and scenarios, training data is bounded and such models have shown signs of brittleness, leading to failures that undermine reliable deployment. Discussions at the previous iteration of the OWN workshop clearly highlighted these and other persistent gaps in robustness and reliability when applying foundation models to navigation. Building on these insights, this second edition of the OWN workshop aims to explore these gaps by advancing our understanding of foundation models’ failure modes and exploring principled approaches to failure handling. Overall, the workshop seeks to drive a focused discussion on how to progress toward OWN with foundation models, with an emphasis on building robust, reliable, and failure-resilient systems.

In particular, this workshop aims to answer the questions:

* What role do foundation models play in building systems for open-world navigation? What capabilities do current models provide, and what missing capabilities must be developed to support open-world navigation? 
* What are the key failure modes of foundation models in navigation, and how should we evaluate and address them?
* How should navigation systems handle the inevitable out-of-distribution scenarios and failures in the open world? How can uncertainty be quantified and failures handled in the context of foundation models?
* What benchmarks are needed to gauge progress in open-world navigation?
